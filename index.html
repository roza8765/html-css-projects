          Perennials live for three years or more – their name comes the Latin,
          ‘perennis’, which means ‘many years’. They are sometimes referred to
          ‘herbaceous perennials’. They can flower for several months in summer.
          There are two types: Hardy perennials can survive the winter and are
          left in the ground all year round. Don’t be alarmed when they seem to
          ‘disappear’ in winter – it’s a survival mechanism to get through the
          cold weather. Their foliage dies back but the rootstock remains
          dormant underground. New shoots then appear in spring. Popular
          perennials include lupins, delphiniums, cranesbills, hostas and
          peonies.

            Shrubs, such as roses and lavender, have a woody branches and no trunk. They can be deciduous (they lose their leaves in winter), evergreen (they keep their leaves year-round) or semi-evergreen (they keep their leaves in mild winters). Shrubs add structure and can last for many years, offering flowers, attractive foliage, colourful autumn leaves or berries. Evergreen types can be used as topiary, clipped into attractive shapes.

              Bulbs are underground storage organs and there are several different kinds – true bulbs, corms, tubers and rhizomes. They are planted in autumn or spring for spring or summer flowers. They include a wide range of popular garden plants including daffodils (pictured), tulips, bluebells, crocus, irises and dahlias.

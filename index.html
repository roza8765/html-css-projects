                Perennials live for three years or more – their name comes the
                Latin, ‘perennis’, which means ‘many years’. They are sometimes
                referred to ‘herbaceous perennials’. They can flower for several
                months in summer. There are two types: Hardy perennials can
                survive the winter and are left in the ground all year round.
                Don’t be alarmed when they seem to ‘disappear’ in winter – it’s
                a survival mechanism to get through the cold weather. Their
                foliage dies back but the rootstock remains dormant underground.
                New shoots then appear in spring. Popular perennials include
                lupins, delphiniums, cranesbills, hostas and peonies.

                Shrubs, such as roses and lavender, have a woody branches and no
                trunk. They can be deciduous (they lose their leaves in winter),
                evergreen (they keep their leaves year-round) or semi-evergreen
                (they keep their leaves in mild winters). Shrubs add structure
                and can last for many years, offering flowers, attractive
                foliage, colourful autumn leaves or berries. Evergreen types can
                be used as topiary, clipped into attractive shapes.

                Bulbs are underground storage organs and there are several
                different kinds – true bulbs, corms, tubers and rhizomes. They
                are planted in autumn or spring for spring or summer flowers.
                They include a wide range of popular garden plants including
                daffodils (pictured), tulips, bluebells, crocus, irises and
                dahlias.

                Annuals complete their entire life cycle – growing from seed,
                flowering, making more seed, then dying – in one year (their
                name comes from the Latin ‘annus’, meaning ‘year’). They produce
                masses of bright, showy flowers in summer. There are two types.

                Biennials take two years to complete their life cycle – they are
                sown in one year and flower and die in the next (their name
                comes from the Latin word, ‘biennis’, which means ‘two years’.
                They often flower in late spring, before annuals and perennials
                get going. The most common biennial in our gardens is the
                foxglove.

                Bedding plants are planted temporarily in flower beds or
                borders, pots or window boxes, giving a display of flowers for a
                few months. Bedding plants are often half-hardy annuals or
                tender perennials, but can also be bulbs or shrubs. Popular
                bedding plants include pelargoniums (geraniums), begonias,
                petunias and pansies
